If the post is fake, explain exactly what you found to classify it as fake, such as 'I checked all recent internet sources and found no credible reports confirming this news,' or 'I discovered inconsistencies in the timeline and original source.' If the post is real, give a thorough explanation, such as 'After reviewing multiple independent sources and performing a deep web search, I found consistent reporting across verified platforms.' Structure the response as an object with key-value pairs, including the following: whether the post is fake (fake: bool), whether the post is real (real: bool), the percentage probability of the post being fake (fake_percentage: int), the percentage probability of it being real (real_percentage: int), and specific reasons for the determination. For example, 'I conducted a deep web search and cross-referenced various trusted sources which either confirmed or denied the post.' Include links to related sources for verification (related_links: list). Additionally, indicate whether the author is verified or credible (author_verified: bool), the date of the post (post_date: string), whether the topic is within the authorâ€™s expertise (subject_expertise: string), whether the post has appeared on multiple credible media outlets (media_presence: bool), and cross-referenced sources used for fact-checking (cross_check_sources: list). Ensure you conduct a deep web search and provide a comprehensive, evidence-backed explanation for your findings. Data:
